        Refund Policy for AgriConnect At AgriConnect, we strive to ensure that
        every customer has a positive shopping experience. In case you encounter
        issues with one of our products or services, we offer a transparent and
        straightforward refund policy as outlined below: Eligibility for Returns
        and Refunds Products must be returned within 30 days of receipt in their
        original condition and packaging. Customers must obtain a Return
        Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number before returning items. RMA
        numbers can be obtained by contacting our Customer Support team via
        email at agricconnect20@gmail.com or calling +91 9175077267 during
        business hours. Items purchased using discount codes or promotions are
        not eligible for return unless they arrive damaged or defective.
        Shipping costs associated with the initial delivery are nonrefundable.
        However, customers receiving incorrect or damaged goods will receive
        free return shipping labels upon request. The cost of return shipping is
        the responsibility of the customer unless the product arrives damaged or
        defective. Refunds will be issued once the item(s) have been received
        and inspected by our warehouse staff. Refunds will be made using the
        same method of payment used for the original purchase. If a product is
        found to be faulty or does not match its description, customers will be
        entitled to a full refund. Refunds will not be provided for change of
        mind or if the product was used or installed. Damaged or Defective Goods
        In cases where products are delivered damaged or defective, customers
        should report the issue immediately after discovery. Our Customer
        Support team will work with the customer to resolve the problem
        promptly. Cancellations Customers wishing to cancel their order prior to
        shipment may do so without penalty. Canceled orders will result in a
        full refund being processed. Exceptions There may be instances where
        exceptions apply to our standard refund policy. These situations will be
        communicated clearly to affected customers. Updates to this Policy This
        Refund Policy may be updated periodically to better serve our customers.
        Any updates will be posted on our website and communicated to our
        customers via email. Contact Us For further assistance regarding our
        Refund Policy, please reach out to our Customer Support team at
        agriconnect20@gmail.com or call +91-9175077267 during business hours.
