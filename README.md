# Cdac_Project_AgriConnect 

Our project aims to develop an application that provides a platform for farmers to navigate and find agricultural products and farming equipment. The application will help farmers save costs by allowing them to compare products and navigate them to the respective shops. It will not be an e-commerce website, but rather a tool that connects farmers with local shops and service providers, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information on product availability and prices. In addition, we plan to include a subservice in the application for non-farmers to purchase nursery plants and components. This will expand the application's utility to a wider audience, allowing non-farmers to access and purchase nursery plants and related components conveniently.
